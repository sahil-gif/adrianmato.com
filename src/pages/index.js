    <Bio>
      For the last 12+ years, I've designed digital products between Madrid,
      London and now, from San Francisco. I also co-founded and later sold my
      company Erasmusu.
    </Bio>
    <Bio>
      My career started as a Software Developer but it soon became clear that my
      true passion was Design. I love combining both skillsets to create
      products that fulfill a clear purpose.
