    <p>
      For the last 12+ years, I've designed digital products between Madrid, London and now, from
      San Francisco. I also co-founded and later sold my company Erasmusu.

    <p>
      My career started as a Software Developer but it soon became clear that my true passion was Design.
      I love combining both skillsets to create products that fulfill a clear purpose.
